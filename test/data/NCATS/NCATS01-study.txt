study	NCATS	NCATS01	123456789	Models for diagnosis and treatment of human cancers using comparative canine-human transcriptomics	"The goal of the study was to identify gene groups (conserved gene modules) common to both canine and human cancers, to facilitate drug testing in dogs. To accomplish this, experimental and bioinformatics methods were used to analyze seven canine cancer tissue types to discover gene modules relevant to cancer in canines. Biochemical pathways and controlling transcription factors were also identified as factors associated with the gene modules. Ultimately, the gene modules were used to identify cancer biomarkers and drug repurposing hypotheses suitable for experimental validation in both canines and humans."	transcriptomics and proteomics analysis	20061218	June 2017 - June 2018
