program	National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences	NCATS	NCATS purpose is to catalyze a transformation in the way health interventions are developed and to bring more treatments to more patients more quickly.	"The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is transforming translational science to get more treatments to more patients more quickly.  NCATS relies on the power of data, new technologies and teamwork to develop, demonstrate and disseminate innovations that reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in translational research.

Rather than targeting a particular disease or area of fundamental science, NCATS focuses on what is common across diseases and the translational process. The Center conducts and supports research on both the scientific and operational aspects of translation to lead to more predictive and successful development of new medical interventions, such as drugs, diagnostics, and medical devices, for all human diseases.

NCATS' efforts by design complement and empower those of other NIH ICs, academic scientists, the private sector and the nonprofit community. By emphasizing collaboration, innovation, deliverables and team science, the Center serves as a catalyst to enable others in the translational research ecosystem to work more effectively."	https://ncats.nih.gov/	0
