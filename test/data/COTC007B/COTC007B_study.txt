study	COP	COTC007B	844701	Preclinical Evaluation of Three Idenoisoquinoline Candidates in Tumor-Bearing Dogs	"A clinical trial of 3 indenoisoquinolines candidates in tumor-bearing dogs is intended to define their safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic modulation. The trial is divided into 2 steps: (1) dose escalation, tolerability, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study and (2) cohort enrichment at a range of disease to extend the PK-PD profile of each agent. Study objectives are to distinguish the toxicity profiles of these agents and determine a difference in biological activity if one exists. A pilot study with Topotecan was performed in the same population of dogs to establish a PK/PD profile to serve as a comparator for the novel therapy phase. The pilot confirmed the validity of approach, assay (?-H2AX) reproducibility, and will direct the conduct of the indenoisoquinoline evaluation. "	Clinical Trial	20120424	June 2013 to October 2014
